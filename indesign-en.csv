The difference in flow speed between condensation and flow is the dynamic phenomenon that gives the trap its name (thermodynamic). The stainless steel disc is the only moving part. It can handle water hammer and high temperatures. Fast discharge quickly dissipates condensate and helps to maintain the system temperature. The audible discharge cycle makes checking the operation easy. When flashing condensate enters the cartridge, flow velocity increases, creating low pressure underneath the disc. Flashing condensate at high velocity strikes the inside wall of the disc chamber at hihgh velocity and is deflected to the top of the disc, causing a pressure buildup. The disc is forced down onto the seat by this pressure imbalance. The trap remains closed as flashing vapor in the control chamber keeps the disc seated. Pressure inside the cap is not lowered until the trapped flash vapor condenses due to body radiation. Condensing steam lowers the pressure above the disc. The disc is then lifted, and the cycle is repeated. The stainless steel disc is the only moving part. A low initial cost is less expensive than repairable technologies.Handles water hammer and superheat.Blast discharge quickly draws condensate and helps maintain system temperature.Resists both internal and external corrosion.The audible discharge cycle makes checking operations simple.

These Diaphragm Replacement Valves (DRVs) have the same interior dimensions as standard stainless steel tube sizes, so they can fit seamlessly into existing processes. Just unclamp and replace! Switch over from traditional diaphragm valves to a DRV easily and adopt single-use processing. The DRV brings process improvements by offering a design that is free of shear, hold-ups and flow restrictions when in an open state. The complete single-use contact layer benefits the user by eliminating the need for cleaning and ensures functional reliability of critical valves at point of use.  PNEUMATIC DIAPHRAGM REPLACEMENT VALVES The Diaphragm Replacement Valves are available in a variety of connection sizes, enabling seamless valve replacement in existing processes. Besides the DRV with pneumatic operation we've also got a manual operated DRV. The simple and secure fluid contact layer set up allows for quick and reliable fluid control at a predictable operating cost. The engineered full bore, encapsulated design allows for downsized process equipment and increased closure resistance, enabling higher level of process safety and drug yields in bioprocessing.   LINERS WITH INTEGRATED GASKETS The single-use liner internal diameters range from 9.4 mm (0.37 in.) up to 34.8 mm(1.37 in.), in close alignment to the ASME BPE standard. The liners come with integrated gaskets, thereby minimizing the connection sealing surface and reducing the number of additional parts. With a range of sizes, the Diaphragm Replacement Valves are suitable for use in liquid or gas fluid streams from upstream processing, downstream processing through to formulation and filling. The DRVs are also designed for use in both traditional and hybrid facilities. The valve bodies are manufactured from high end 316L stainless steel ensuring they meet the highest quality standards.

Due to the large capacity and open screen area, sock screens require less service therefore reducing down time and costly change outs, a major consideration with in-line pharmaceutical processing. While protecting expensive processing pumps and equipment from foreign matter, sock screens are especially effective in decreasing pump wear and burnout while increasing energy conservation.

The V2B screen will fit perfectly into the ID of a sanitary pipe and can be used for inflow fluid conditioning filtration. Providing Air Flow Without ContaminationA key benefit of the V2B Gasket is its prevention from most atmospheric and environmental contamination customarily found with other venting systems. Because the V2B Gasket can provide unrestricted air flow with ultra fine filtration, you can feel secure in knowing the hygienic condition of the tank contents remain protected. With regular cleaning and maintenance, the V2B Gasket is a cost effective, and incredibly simple way to provide contaminate free air flow to any tank system.","WBC ","V2B Gaskets offer an additional solution for vacuum and pressure relief for pharmaceutical, food and beverage processing tank venting when airborne particulate removal is required.

The Beta Bag allows you to transfer components and materials in and out of an isolator or RABS, while minimizing the risks of microbial and particulate contamination. This assures the most sterile, aseptic process possible, while eliminating costly and time-consuming cleaning and sterilization procedures. The opening size is 190mm, which means it is compatible with Getinge® style Alpha ports. This can accommodate objects with a width of 170 to 175mm. ROMYNOX can help you with aseptic production by pre-filling the Beta Bags with your desired objects.Because we sell from our own stock and have ISO 7 cleanroom capacity for pre-packing, this is possible with fast turnaround times. The Beta Bag consists of a single layer of material. Tyvek® and a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic that are welded together to form a strong connection. Tyvek® is a high-density polyethylene fiber used as a sterile barrier to allow autoclave sterilization. HDPE has an excellent strength-to-density ratio, which gives it excellent tensile strength and is highly resistant to tearing or ripping. In addition, it is still possible to see the Beta Bag contents. To ensure that components inserted into the isolator meet all sterilization process requirements, the pre-filled beta bag can be autoclaved. The result is a filling line production free from contamination by harmful bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms. The Beta Bag is double-bagged in a polyethylene cleanroom bag.

Traditional sanitary fittings consist of three components: Two ferrules Gasket Clamp Most ferrules are made from stainless steel and must conform to Bio Processing Equipment standards to ensure they work with each other, regardless of the manufacturer. The gasket seals the ferrules preventing leaks when clamped. The clamp compresses the gasket between the two ferrules, effectively leak-proofing the ferrules. With aSURE fittings, the built-in gasket becomes part of the sanitary tri-clamp fitting. The fitting and gasket are combined into a single product, manufactured without adhesives and/or clips holding the gasket in place. This adds another layer of safety and security to sanitary fittings. The aSURE fittings product advantage: Cost Effective Without fear of contamination, there is less product waste and scrapped batches due to accidental contamination Easy Installation Most tri-clamps on the market require two men to safely install without contamination. aSure fittings ensure the built-in gasket remains sterile by requiring zero contact between the user and the gasket Product Safety The self-adjusting lightweight, limited slip design allows for a great seal with no risk of misalignment.","HRS ","aSURE's patent-pending design design marries the properties of an elastomaric gasket in to a singular sanitary rigid sanitary Tri-Clamp fitting.","No Hand Contact With Gasket RXBLLTEnsures Proper Alignment RXBLLTIncreased Throughput RXBLLTGuarantees Gasket Placement (Gasket not Left Out) RXBLLTEnsures Approved Gasket Material is Installed RXBLLTReduce Contamination Risk RXBLLTNon-Pyrogenic RXBLLTaSURE's Barbs are Compatible with Most Flexible Tubing RXBLLTSterilizable by autoclave, ETO or gamma radiation",/product-images/TBL-aSURE-Fittings.jpg,,,,4.1,,40,,,,,,,,15.16,54.58
